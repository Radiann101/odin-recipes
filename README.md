Recipes HTML test page
This site will be a test for everything i've learned so far.
At the end i will come back to it, and reflect on what i've learnt and used to make the site possible.


After pushing it on GitHub:

-I've created an index.html "home" page
-I've created two separate pages, that one can go to from "home", "lasagna.html" + "pizza.html"
-In both of these I've used:
		<a href="./recipes/****.html" target="_blank">Go to **** recipe</a>
		<img src="" alt="" height="" width="">
		<ul></ul>
		<ol></ol>
		<li><li>
		<a href="../index.html">Return to home page</a>
